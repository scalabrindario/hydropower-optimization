h1>Original Problem</h1>

The code in the GitHub file called "original_problem" creates a base line model for a hydroelectric power station aimed at generating the most amount of profit. The variables that are being used at p_t = flow of water through the turbine, q_t = flow of water directed to the spillway, a_t = amount of water inputted into the resivoir by the watershed and weather, amd finally V_t = the volume of water in the resevoir.

h1>Augmented Problem</h1>

The code in the GitHub file called "augmented_problem" expandes on base model by adding different parameters, like solar power, pumping water back up, and creating an insentive in the cost function to favor more water in the resevoir.
